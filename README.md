# leetcode-algos

> A curated collection of my solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from LeetCode. This repository serves as a personal log for my daily practice, a tool for future review, and a showcase of my problem-solving skills for technical interviews.

## The Purpose of This Repository

My goal isn't just to find *a* solution, but to find an *optimal* one and—more importantly—to **understand the "why"** behind it.

In a professional setting, writing code that is clean, efficient, and well-documented is critical. This repository reflects that philosophy. Each solution is structured to demonstrate not just the final code, but the analytical process to get there.

## Languages & Status

I am primarily solving problems using **C#**.

| Language | Problems Solved |
| :--- | :--- |
| **C#** | `[4]` |


*(This status table will be updated as I solve more problems.)*

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by algorithm category or data structure.

* `/Arrays`
* `/Math`
* `/Hashing`
* `/BitManipulation`
* *(...and more as they are added)*

Inside each problem's folder (e.g., `/Arrays/1-TwoSum/`), you will find:
* `Solution.cs`
* `README.md` (The file explaining the problem analysis and approach)
